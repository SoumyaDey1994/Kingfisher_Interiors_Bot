SOURCING CONFIGURATION 3.1. ADD SOURCING CONFIGURATION TO A PRODUCT Client XYZ business will associate vendor and factory where the product is being sourced. In the system this will be done through sourcing configuration. Once the product is ready on the line sheet the CLIENT XYZ will associate source to the product. This is possible that the source if different in different season, hence they will maintain source to a season by indicating on the product sourcing configuration. Designer will create the Products and will send the details to CLIENT XYZ. CLIENT XYZ will assign factories to the Product for bulk production. Whichever factories will be responsible for sampling CLIENT XYZ will add them in Sampling page itself. In Client XYZ business, if any factory is developing the product samples it doesn ͛ t necessary that the particular factory should do the bulk production as well. It will depends upon the quote that factory provided.

SAMPLE MANAGEMENT Overview: The samples are general requested by the EMEA and US team to PD Asia. PD Asia will get the sample developed from the vendor factory and send it to EMEA & US team for approval. Regional teams while ordering the samples share the technical drawing and Colorform. PD Asia allocates the samples to the factory based on the availability of the capacity. There are 2 different kind of samples requested  Material – Colour sample – Lab dip or Strike off  Product samples – Concept, Proto, Finalisation Sample, Soft Lock, Post Buy Sample and SMS Sample. MaterialColour development sample will be used by both EMEA and US team. In product sample EMEA will manage Concept, Proto and Soft Lock sample. The US team will manage Concept, Proto, Finalisation, SMS and Post Buy samples. EMEA will continue to manage SMS sample outside FlexPLM as these are managed through ERP system as small production order. In the business the tracking and approval happens at the sample request level even if there are multiple quantities requested in one sample request. Most of the sample requests in the business are at colorway level. 6.1 PRODUCT SAMPLES  Business Process: In product sampling the process will be as follows  Design / merchandise team will create the sample request to PD Asia (CLIENT XYZ) and PD Asia (CLIENT XYZ) will allocate the sample request to the vendor factory  PD Asia (CLIENT XYZ) will be a dummy finished goods factory in the system.  PD Asia (CLIENT XYZ) upon receiving the sample request will send it to vendor factory and the Finished good factory name in the sample request will be updated  PD Asia (CLIENT XYZ) will be responsible for coordinating with the supplier and to send the samples on time.  Any feedback / comments from the vendor factory and the shipping information from PD Asia (CLIENT XYZ) to regional teams will be updated by the PD Asia (CLIENT XYZ) team in the system Note: Product Samples can be created in multiple ways in FlexPLM. The multiple ways are: 1. From a specific Product Sample page within a Product: If user wants to create sample for a particular Product. 2. From Season Line Sheet: If user wants to create samples for multiple products within a Season. 3. From VRD Sample Tracking: If user wants to create Samples for multiple Products within multiple seasons.
